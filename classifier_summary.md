## ⚙️ Classifier Details

### 1️⃣ Random Forest Classifier
- **Description:** Ensemble of decision trees combined by voting or averaging.  
- **Strengths:** Simple, interpretable, ranks feature importance.  
- **Weaknesses:** Poor with noisy/high-dimensional data; cannot capture temporal relationships.  

> “The random forests approach ranks features for attack class classification … performs poorly when dealing with noisy and multi-dimensional traffic data.”

---

### 2️⃣ Naïve Bayes Classifier
- **Description:** Probabilistic model assuming independence between features.  
- **Strengths:** Fast, lightweight, easy to implement.  
- **Weaknesses:** Independence assumption rarely holds for correlated network features.  

---

### 3️⃣ Logistic Regression
- **Description:** Linear model estimating probability for binary classification.  
- **Strengths:** Interpretable, easy to train.  
- **Weaknesses:** Cannot model non-linear decision boundaries.  

---

### 4️⃣ k-Means (Unsupervised)
- **Description:** Clustering-based approach for anomaly detection.  
- **Strengths:** Can detect previously unseen (unknown) attacks.  
- **Weaknesses:** Sensitive to initial cluster count and overlapping classes.  

---

### 5️⃣ DNN (Deep Neural Network Classifier)
- **Description:** Multi-layer perceptron with Softmax output.  
- **Strengths:** Learns non-linear patterns; good supervised classifier.  
- **Weaknesses:** Fails to capture temporal context; prone to overfitting.  

> “The softmax activation function … used in binary classification tasks.”

---

### 6️⃣ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Description:** Extracts local features using convolutional filters.  
- **Strengths:** Reduces parameters; good with structured input.  
- **Weaknesses:** Limited temporal awareness for sequential traffic data.  

> “The FCL … initiates the result layer via softmax … categorical cross-entropy … used to measure the loss.”

---

### 7️⃣ LSTM-AE (Proposed Model)
- **Description:** Two-stage Encoder–Decoder Autoencoder with LSTM cells and Softmax classifier.  
- **Strengths:**
  - Learns long-term temporal dependencies.  
  - High Accuracy, Recall, and F1-Score; low False Alarm Rate (FAR).  
  - Generalizes across multiple public datasets.  
- **Weaknesses:** Requires GPU; computationally heavy; needs well-cleaned input data.

> “The proposed LSTM-AE model … outperforms DNN and CNN models … achieving high accuracy with lower loss rate.”
